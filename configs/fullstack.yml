  This is a full-stack project with multiple programming languages. I've configured:
  - TypeScript language server (frontend)
  - Python language server (backend)
  - Editing mode - code can be modified
  - Interactive mode - will confirm actions with you

  Common tasks:
  - "Analyze frontend and backend structure" - Understand project architecture
  - "Add new API" - Develop backend endpoints
  - "Add new page" - Develop frontend pages
  - "Fix bug" - Debug and fix issues
  - "Optimize performance" - Improve application performance
