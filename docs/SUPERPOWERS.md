Workflow:
1. Understand the problem
2. Generate hypotheses
3. Design experiments
4. Execute experiments
5. Analyze results
6. Repeat or fix

**When to use**: Encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior

### verification-before-completion
**Purpose**: Verify before claiming work is complete

Checklist:
- Is the functionality fully implemented?
- Do tests pass?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is documentation updated?
- Has code been reviewed?

**When to use**: Before committing or claiming completion

## Code Review Skills

## Using with Serena

### Typical Workflows

1. **Project Initialization**
   ```
   → Use OpenSem to configure project
   → Serena activates project
   → Use brainstorming to plan features
   → Use writing-plans to create implementation plan
   ```

2. **Feature Development**
   ```
   → Use test-driven-development to write tests
   → Implement code (Serena assisted)
   → Use systematic-debugging to debug issues
   → Use verification-before-completion to verify
   → Use requesting-code-review to review code
   ```

3. **Bug Fixing**
   ```
   → Use systematic-debugging to diagnose issues
   → Fix code (Serena assisted)
   → Verify fix
   → Update documentation
   ```

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills might apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills** (brainstorming, debugging) - determine how to approach task
2. **Implementation skills** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - guide execution
