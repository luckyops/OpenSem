  This is a TypeScript project. I've configured:
  - TypeScript language server (supports .ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx files)
  - Editing mode - code can be modified
  - Interactive mode - will confirm actions with you

  Common tasks:
  - "Analyze code structure" - Understand project architecture
  - "Add new feature" - Develop new features
  - "Fix bug" - Debug and fix issues
  - "Refactor code" - Optimize code structure

  Let me know what you need help with!
