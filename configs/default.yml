  Welcome to {PROJECT_NAME}!

  I've configured basic settings for you.
  If you need more specialized configuration (such as TypeScript, Python, etc.), please let me know the project type.

  Available commands:
  - "Configure as TypeScript project" - Enable TypeScript support
  - "Configure as Python project" - Enable Python support
  - "Analyze project structure" - Understand code organization
  - "Get to work" - Start with your task directly

  Let me know what you need help with!
